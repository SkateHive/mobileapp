# CreatePost Updates Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Video Upload Service Migration
- Migrated from Pinata to custom video transcoding service
- Removed all Pinata-related environment variables and dependencies
- Updated video upload to use new API endpoint: `https://video-worker-e7s1.onrender.com/transcode`
- Videos now return CID and gateway URL directly from the service

### 2. Simplified for Microblog/Comments Only
- Removed title input field and related state
- Simplified to only create comments/microblog posts (no long-form posts)
- Updated UI to focus on quick content sharing

### 3. Testing Mode
- **Commented out the blockchain posting line** in `handlePost()`
- Added detailed `console.log()` to show what would be sent to blockchain
- Success message now says "Your post data is ready! Check console for details."

### 4. Updated Button Text
- Changed "Post" to "Share" to better reflect microblog nature

## How to Test

1. **Create a post with content and/or media**
2. **Check the console output** - you'll see something like:
   ```javascript
   üìù Post data prepared for blockchain: {
     body: "Your content with media markup",
     parentAuthor: "",
     parentPermlink: "hive-173115",
     username: "yourusername",
     images: ["image_url_if_any"],
     videos: ["video_ipfs_hash_if_any"]
   }
   ```

3. **When ready to enable blockchain posting**, uncomment these lines in `handlePost()`:
   ```javascript
   // await createHiveComment(
   //   postBody,
   //   "", // No parent for microblog
   //   COMMUNITY_TAG, // Use community tag as parent permlink
   //   {
   //     username,
   //     privateKey: session.decryptedKey,
   //   }
   // );
   ```

## Current Flow
1. User adds content and/or media
2. Media gets uploaded (images to Hive, videos to custom transcoding service)
3. Post body gets formatted with media markup
4. **Data is logged to console** (instead of posting to blockchain)
5. Success message shows and form clears

The media upload functionality is fully working, just the final blockchain posting is commented out for testing.
